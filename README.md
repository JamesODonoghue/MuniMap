James O'Donoghue

> This is a sample Project which uses the NextBus API to display SF Muni buses in (almost) real-time


## Tech Stack



-  D3 for map and bus drawing/color/manipulation
-  VueJS for view rendering
-  Webpack for bundling and minification
-  Axios for HTTP requests


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
